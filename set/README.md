# System Evaluation Tool (SET)

This is an EVE Online tool. It's designed to take in data from your Probe Window (after you've scanned all the signatures ideally), and then calculate the ISK value each individual signature and therefore the system as a whole.

## Usage

1. `Control + A` and `Control + C` the data inside of the Probe Window
1. `Control + V` that data inside an open copy of `index.html`

You'll get a list you can observe.

## Data

The data is inside of `database.json` and was extracted from [Grubu's Maintained Nolak's Updated Karr's Modified Rykki's Guide 1.5](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSaCHnBRDw8Ki6nuamMzQv3InN978Zh7F6RcwlYdJHnlQkDrrdz5zrG3Of_8eoyxeqJimMHt9-7GjLn/pubhtml#) with the help (and sometimes hinderence) of ChatGPT.
